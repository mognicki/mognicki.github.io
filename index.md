# Resume

Hello, I'm Marek Ognicki-Kapusta*, and this is my full resume. I know that
one-page resumes are usually not enough to describe one's personality,
experience and achievements - that's why I hope this way of presenting my
resume will find appreciation.

_*) officially Marek Kapusta, but I use the Ognicki name on a daily basis_
