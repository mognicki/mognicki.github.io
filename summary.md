I'm the experienced fullstack developer, focusing on such languages/technologies
as:

- **PHP** with **Laravel** as the framework-of-choice,
- **JS**, with **Vue.js**/**Nuxt.js** and **Node.js** skills.

Besides, I have experience in the following languages/technologies as well:

- both SQL and NoSQL databases (incl. MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, RethinkDB,
Redis),
- git with gitflow,
- cloud solutions, particularly Google App Engine, but also such services
  as Heroku or similar.

As a developer with both IT and non-IT background, I acknowledge the 
importance of well-written, optimized, tested, and documented code. With my 
inderdisciplinary knowledge and quick learning abilities, I find best 
motivation in solving challenging and complex problems. Iâ€™m also a devoted 
supporter of _can-do_ attitude, which finds its confirmation in my previous
clients' opinions.

Having worked mostly remotely, I believe I will fit any remote-based
company's organization flow easily.~~~~
